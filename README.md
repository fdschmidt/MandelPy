# MandelPy

MandelPy is a Mandelbrot visualization tool for Linux, Windows, and Macs based on Python3. It can be executed as a Jupyter Notebook or inside a Widget with the option to change the computational grid, the resolution, the number of iterations, the threshold, and the colour map. Generated Mandelbrot plots can be saved as png files if the corresponding option is selected.

## Requirements
MandelPy was initially written using *Python3.6.2* but should work with older Python3 installations
as well. In addition, the following Python libraries are required: *numpy*, *matplotlib*,
and *datetime* for both the Jupyter Notebook and the Widget and *tkinter* for the Widget
only.

## Instructions
Once you have downloaded the source code, unpack it and navigate into the MandelPy directory.
You can find the user manual as a PDF and LaTeX source file in the directory *UserManual*.
The Jupyter Notebook can be found in the *JupyterNotebook* directory and can be opened as
a standard Jupyter Notebook file. The widget source code is in the *GUI* directory. To start the
GUI, type ”python MandelPy.py” into your terminal and a seperate window for the widget
should pop up. You can set the input parameters in the right frame of the widget. The graphs will be displayed in the right frame. If you tick the *save* box, all generated plots will automatically be saved in the *GUI* directory.
